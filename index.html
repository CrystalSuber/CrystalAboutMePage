     I am 19 years old born and raised in the Bay Area currently living in San Francisco. In my free time I like to hang out with my friends or just all in all get quality me time It's important for me to get a job in the tech industry because first and foremost I am a black woman, two words that are rare when it comes to the people that occupy tech insutry jobs. There is a gap between minorities and the occupation of coporate jobs and I wanna be the addition to bridge this gap in hopes that there will be change all around in the amount of people of color occupying these jobs. Growing up, my dad was the person in the house that had history and tech and was the person in the house that we would go to get our tech related answered and to fix something related to that in the house. I aspire to be like that I am a person of color first, so it's even more important for me to make it.
